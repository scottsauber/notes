# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson

Listened to on Audible

# Main Premise

The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more things, but instead giving a fuck about less and focusing on the things that align with your personal values.

### Motivation - Do Something Principle

- Many people think that to take action follows the path of Inspiration => Motivation => Action. But it's actually Action => Inspiration => Motivation. Your Action will spawn motivation and the inspiration will follow after that as you do more.
- The "Do Something" Principle - if you lack motivation to make a change in your life, then do something and the motivation will follow.
- Focus on Processes like "I'm going to get better at my work", not goals like "owning a lake house." Because once you achieve that goal it can no longer provide happiness. Processes never end which means happiness can continue on indefinitely.

### Success

- Your definition of success aligns with what your values are. Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica and instead joined Megadeth. By all accounts he was a success, but he judged his own success based on whether or not he was more successful than Metallica. Therefore he was a failure in his eyes.
- The desire for a better life is itself a negative experience. Paradoxically, if you accept your negative experience, then it's actually a positive experience.
- Pursuing something reinforces that you don't have it in the first place

### Identity

- Manson's Law of Avoidance - the more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. If I believe I'm a nice guy, I'll avoid situations where it could contradict that belief.
- Certainty is the enemy of growth.

### Responsibility

- Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solving them.

### Random Notes

- Commitment to one thing is liberating, not constraining. It relieves you of all second guessing out there and focuses you.
- If there is no reason to do anything, if life is pointless, then there is also no reason to not do anything. What do you have to lose? You’re going to die anyway, so your fears and embarrassments and failures don’t mean anything. You might as well try.

# Interview Questions

Questions I like besides the "what SOLID principles have you memorized" type of questions. In general, I care about two things _**attitude**_ and _**aptitude**_. Are you a positive influence on the team? Are you capable of learning? If you have those two things, I want you on my team.

### Problem Solving in the dark

- Talk to me about a time when you had to develop a solution without data in front of you to point you to the right solution. How did you come to that solution and what led you to thinking it was correct?

### Asking about creating a brand new application:

- What stack are you using?
- Why did you choose that stack?
- What architecture patterns are you using?
- Why did you choose those patterns?
- How do you ensure quality?
- How often are you deploying to Production?

It's intentionally semi-ambiguous to see where they fill in the gaps and see if they ask any follow up questions.

### Other Questions:

- How do you stay current?
- What's your biggest problem at work and why haven't you solved it?

### Coaching

- What interests you about being a coach over a tech lead?
- What do you think the difference is between a coach and tech lead?
- Say you've got this idea in your head and you're like "oh man, this would be perfect for this client" but you know they're currently not doing that thing. In fact they may be doing the opposite, but don't see anything wrong with it. How would you go about getting that idea implemented in the organization?
- How do you like giving feedback? Receiving?
- What do you think about pair programming? TDD?
- How do you decide between coaching the team vs coaching individuals?
- How do you handle "we don't have time for tests"?

### "Pairing" session

- Something simple like a REST API that is empty
- Failing integration test for the /{noun} call
- See where they go... do they do TDD? Do they add layers? Do they write new integration tests?
- Ping pong if it makes sense, although I don't mind being more of an observer here and asking questions

### Creating a PR for them to review

I like the idea of staging a PR for them to review. Some ideas to intentionally "plant" in your staged PR:

- Bugs
- Duplicate code
- Clever tricks that work but are slightly unclear
- Missing tests
- Cod they should ask clarifying questions on.

See if they ask to pull down the code and run it. Have them talk through their code review process.

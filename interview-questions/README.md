# Interview Questions

Questions I like besides the "what SOLID principles have you memorized" type of questions. In general, I care about two things _**attitude**_ and _**aptitude**_. Are you a positive influence on the team? Are you capable of learning? If you have those two things, I want you on my team.


### Problem Solving in the dark

- Talk to me about a time when you had to develop a solution without data in front of you to point you to the right solution.  How did you come to that solution and what led you to thinking it was correct?

### Asking about creating a brand new application:

- What stack are you using?
- Why did you choose that stack?
- What architecture patterns are you using?
- Why did you choose those patterns?
- How do you ensure quality?
- How often are you deploying to Production?

It's intentionally semi-ambiguous to see where they fill in the gaps and see if they ask any follow up questions.

### "Pairing" session

- Something simple like a REST API that is empty
- Failing integration test for the /{noun} call
- See where they go... do they do TDD?  Do they add layers? Do they write new integration tests? 
- Ping pong if it makes sense, although I don't mind being more of an observer here and asking questions

### Creating a PR for them to review

I like the idea of staging a PR for them to review. Some ideas to intentionally "plant" in your staged PR:

- Bugs
- Duplicate code
- Clever tricks that work but are slightly unclear
- Missing tests
- Cod they should ask clarifying questions on.

See if they ask to pull down the code and run it. Have them talk through their code review process.

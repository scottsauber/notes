### Overtesting

"Am I testing something unique with this new test? If you aren't, then you need to think about whether or not you should write that one. If this test shouldn't be written or if the other test can be deleted." - Kent Beck (https://youtu.be/dGtasFJnUxI?t=447)

"Only test things can possibly break" - Kent Beck. AKA don't test getters/setters. Don't test the library or the framework

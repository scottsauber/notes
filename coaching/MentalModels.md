More Mental Models: https://app.gumroad.com/d/7594db74b1a33d16625750b2f7475e9b

Mental models do two things: they help you assess how things work and they help you make better decisions. These two concepts underlie everything you do.

For example, how does a rocket engine work (system)? And which type of rocket fuel should you use (decision)?

Without mental models, you typically stumble around in two ways:

- You go wherever your existing momentum takes you. You don't ask questions.
- You use your instincts—shaped by past experiences and memorized advice. This is a better approach than blindly following your momentum, but it's not that much better.

## First Principles

Reduce a bigger idea down to the smallest fundamentals. These small fundamentals are the First Principles. Example: an essay is made up of paragraphs which is made up of sentences which is made up of words which is made up of letters. It reduces assumptions and gets us down to the bare details.

Elon Musk did this by getting past "Batteries are expensive" by looking at the inputs for batteries and realizing the inputs by themselves are not expensive.

## One Level Higher

Repeatedly ask whether you’re optimizing a cog in a machine instead of the machine itself. The higher the level you optimize at, typically the greater your ROI.

## Regret Minimization Framework

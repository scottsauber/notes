- An anti-pattern is just a pattern used in a sub-optimal context. A good practice is just a practice used in the right context. You shouldn't talk about patterns and practices being "good" or "bad" without talking about the context in which they will be used. Every "best practice" should include the context, the benefits, and the negatives of said practice.

- Architecture is like a sound mixer. You can turn up/down various levels such as modularity, consistency, availability, reliability. But changing one usually drowns out another.

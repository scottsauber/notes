According to Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory, people are much more sensitive to negative events than positive ones. This overwhelming fear of loss can cause us to act irrationally.

Ask someone if they'd like a free $10 or flip a coin to either win $100 or lose $50, most would take the free money, despite having +$40 in expected value if they take the coin flip. This is due to Loss Aversion.

Sunk cost fallacy is a form of Loss Aversion.

The "freemium" and "free trial" models also leverages loss aversion, because once someone has something they've gotten used to, they are much less likely to give it up (aka loss).

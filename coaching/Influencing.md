- The difference between manipulation and influencing is your intent. If your intent is to get someone to do/say/think/act a certain way for your own advantage, that's manipulation. If your intent is for the person's benefit, that is not manipulation.

- In order to change someone's mind, you are going to have to give them different experiences than ones they've already had that led them to their current belief system.

- Don't say "I have an idea" because that implies ownership. Instead say "Dumb question..." or "What if we did..." or "That makes me think of..." or "What if we tried..."

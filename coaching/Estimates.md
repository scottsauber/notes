- I’ve found it’s useful to help “business people” understand that estimates are semi-educated guesses by asking them to estimate something about their own domain:

  - How long will that particular item stay on the shelf?
  - How long will that application take to process?
  - How long does it take to build that deck?

- The answer is almost always “well it depends” and then the light bulb usually starts to come on.

- Estimates are a confidence level not binary (70% confident it will be done)

- In response to "How long will that take" ask "How many dollars will this generate or save?"

- We don't ask the Carpenter how many nails he used.

A lot of these came from Jack Dorsey:

1. Make a slide deck of every reason why your company might fail and then reject each reason with why. This will make you think of all the ways you can fail and give you a response to those who question why you might fail.
1. How do they find your product? How do they use it? Why would they come back? How would they tell a friend? Have clear answers to these questions
1. Create a Dos/Dont list that you look at in the morning, at lunch, and at night. Jack's list: Stay present, be vulnerable, stand up straight, drink only lemon water and red wine, 6 sets of 20 squats and 20 push ups daily
1. Ask yourself "Is what I'm doing now the most important thing I could do?" or "If I could look back in 10 years would I be proud of the hour I'm spending right now?"
1. How to fundraise - 1st week meet with everyone you don't want money from, then 2nd week meet with everyone you do want money from. 2nd week they had all the answers to the tough questions.

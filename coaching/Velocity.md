- If you have varying velocities between sprints (if your normal velocity is 20 points and some sprints you have 10, some you have 30 and it yoyo's), this might actually be a good thing. This might mean we're working on innovative things and pushing the limits of our teams capabilities. Consistent velocity might be an indicator that we are working on the same types of things and not pushing the envelope enough.

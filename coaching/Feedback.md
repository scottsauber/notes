# Feedback

Ideas I've come across for giving/receiving feedback. Arguably, the most important thing we can do is to give to others and receive feedback ourselves.

1. The micro yes question. Ask a simple question that is short and let's the brain know that feedback is coming. Gives a moment of buy-in to say yes or no if they are ready or not. Examples: "Can we talk for 5 minutes on how that last conversation went?" or "I have some ideas how we can improve things, can I share them with you."

2. Give data point. Be specific. For positive or negative feedback. Specifically what you saw or heard. Rather than say "you aren't reliable" you say "you said you'd get that email to me, but I still don't have it yet."

3. Show impact. Name how that data point impacted you. "Because I didn't get that email, it blocked me from moving forward with X project" Or even when giving positive feedback "the detail you left in the stories let me grasp the concept faster. Thanks for doing that."

4. End on a question. "How do you see it?" "This is what I think we should do, but what are you thoughts?" Makes a great problem solving situation.

Ask your co-workers for feedback, don't wait for it to come. Create a pull system, not a push.

## Trouble getting constructive feedback?

When people hesitate to give honest feedback on an idea, draft, or performance, ask for a 0-10 score. No one ever says 10. Then ask how I can get closer to a 10. It motivates them to start coaching me and motivates me to be coachable. I want to learn how to close the gap.

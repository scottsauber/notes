### Low Autonomy

Autonomy decreases as dependencies on external people increases. Some dependencies are explicit (Cloud team needs to make a change, SSO owner needs to make a change, etc) and some are more implicit (i.e. needing approval).

Idea for visualizing low autonomy - Permission Tokens:
- Every time someone needs permission to do something, add a "permission token to a jar." 
- This jar then gets reviewed during a retro or is present during standup. 
- Note: this doesn't have to be an actual physical jar with a phsyical token, a virtual representation (i.e. a Miro or Trello board) that captures the same data would suffice.

### Ideas for identifying gaps/knowledge silos on the team

1. Brainstorm with the team the skills necessary to contribute to this team. These can be things like C#, TypeScript, React, AWS (maybe even specific services), TDD, UX, etc.
1. After brainstorming with the team the skills necessary, have everyone self-assess themselves on where they think they're at in each skill. 
  1. This will be a little challenging, because of Dunning Kruger, but one way to mitigate is to give a rating system with definitions of the ratings.
  1. One example would be a 0-5
  1. 0 = I don't know anything about this
  1. 1 = I've heard of it and looked at it before
  1. 2 = I can do it but would need 1:1 help
  1. 3 = I can do it but would need to lean on Google a lot
  1. 4 = I can do it well without much, if any, help
  1. 5 = I could teach a class on it

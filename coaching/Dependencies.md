### Visualizing Dependencies

- Map dependencies with your team in a circle at the center. Draw additional circles for people your team depends on for all kinds of work to move to the Done column (which means deployed and released). Also capture any dependencies that your dependencies have.
- Start capturing how long you wait for each of these dependencies and how often.
- Review at retro time.

What is the goal of software development?

- _Sustainably_ minimize lead time to business impact.

The purpose is to provide business impact. The goal is NOT to produce software. The point of a plumber isn't the pipes, it's to provide water.

Code is not an asset. Code is the cost to getting the business impact.

# Constraints

Imposing constraints can actually focus your mind on the task at hand.  Having no constraints can lead to the paradox of choice and being overwhelmed and causing analysis paralysis.

Sometimes when I need to make a decision or need to focus on creating, I first start by imposing constraints on myself.  This might not be a constraint that lasts forever, but it may be more of a constraint "sprint" and something I'll remove after a period of time or after they've no longer served their purpose.

Types of constraints you can impose upon yourself:
- Time
- Topic
- Length
- Medium
- Platform
- Cadence
- Environment

### Time

Without a time constraint you can be subject to analysis paralysis and waiting until something is "perfect." Set a timer, use the pomodoro technique, create a routine (same time/place), and after a certain amount of time agree to hit the "publish" or "send" button.

### Topic

Choose a topic and stick with it.  You can choose the type of content too such as Actionable (here's how), Analytical (here's what), Aspirational (you can), or Anthropological (here's why).  Choose one type and stick with it for the most part.

### Length

This is one of the biggest constraints you can add.  Limit your word count, number of pages, video duration, etc.

### Medium

Constrain your medium to tweets, videos, podcasts, blogs, instagram, speaking, etc.  Just pick one thing and do it well before expanding outward.

### Platform

Constrain your platform to Twitter, YouTube, Blogging, Emails, etc.  Go all in on one platform to start and build an audience one platform at a time.

### Cadence

Set a schedule and commit to publishing on that same schedule.  Daily, Weekly, Monthly.  Whatever it is, impose that constraint on yourself.

### Environment 

Get rid of anything in your environment that discourages you from working on the things you want to work on.  Remove distractions.  Make it easy to do the "right" thing.

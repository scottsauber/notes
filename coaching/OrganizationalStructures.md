Another implication of Conwayâ€™s Law is that if we have managers deciding on teams, and deciding which services will be built, by which teams, then managers are the real architects.

Having Build and Run teams naturally creates a rift. The Run team becomes tough to staff, and usually resents the Build team. The Build team don't have to deal with the direct consquences of their decisions (i.e. they're not on-call and don't have to do the ongoing support), so they don't ever learn from their mistakes.

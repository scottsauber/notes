An overlooked metric - how long does it take for a new hire to meaningfully contribute to your codebase?

- How much different tech do they need to know?
- How much domain knowledge do they need?
- Are there guide rails to the pit of success?

Is it measured in minutes? Hours? Days? Weeks? Months? Years?

Is pairing a thing your team does or do you throw them to the wolves solo?

How might the answer to that affect how quickly they onboard?

- Dunbar's Number - we can only maintain 150 social relationships.
- Can we get more productive by scaling down? Team + Tools + Code < N. We don't want teams with too many people on the team which increases communication friction. We don't want to have too many tools, because that increases cognitive load. We don't want to have too much code to be repsonsible for, because that increases cognitive load, context switching, and maintenance burden.

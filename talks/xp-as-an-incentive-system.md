Speaker: Kent Beck

- Find cheap ways to experiment. Any time you have an experiment, ask yourself how I can learn this answer as cheaply and as quickly as possible.
- If you can make experimentation cheap enough, then you don't have to think about whether or not an idea is good. Just try it.
- 4 sentence abstract on how to get accepted - What's the problem? Why is it a problem? The startling sentence. The implication of the startling sentence.
- "Don't write unit tests if they're not necessary to get the experiment out. You're going to delete this code anyways. Find out if people like your idea the quickest, cheapest way possible."
- "Success is the ability to regret the mistakes that you made earlier."
  - Slight tweak on this. I'd say "Learning is the ability to identify the mistakes that you made earlier"
- Basing conversation on fear and nothing else, is a red flag.
- [3X: Explore, Expand, Extract](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/fast-slow-in-3x-explore-expand-extract-6d4c94a7539)
- Explore: overcome disinterest, try many small experiments.
- Expand: to overcome bottlenecks to scaling, ease the limitations of the next rate-limiting resource.
- Extract: to sustain growth, continually increase profitability while you finish growing.

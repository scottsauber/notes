"The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist"

"If you want someone to solve a problem, make it their problem."

"A problem is a difference between things as perceived and things as desired."

"Do I want to be free of this thing because it is a hard thing for me or do I want to be free of this thing because it is the wrong thing for me?"
